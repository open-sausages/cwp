# Solr search

## Overview

CWP provides a hosted Solr service to index and search the content of your site. To ensure stability of your stack
this service lives outside of your environments. 

The recipe pulls in the [*silverstripe/fulltextsearch*](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-fulltextsearch) module and
provides configuration to make sure it works out of the box.
Please refer to the main
[fullltextsearch module documentation](https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp/blob/master/docs/en/index.md)
